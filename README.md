Introduction

In OOP programming, a class is a template for creating objects, providing initial values for variables and implementing behaviors to member functions or methods. In many computing languages, the class name is the name of the class and the default constructor of the class, also the type of objects generated by instantiating the class.
						
The object that is created by a constructor of the class is called an instance of the class, and the member variables corresponding to that object are instance variables which contrast with the class variables shared within the class.
						
In some languages, classes are only a compile-time feature and they can not be declared at runtime. However, in other languages, classes are first-class citizens which are generally themselves objects and in these languages metaclass is a class that creates classes.
